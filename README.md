This repository contains the MATLAB source code developed for the Master of Science thesis regarding the PRIMO Spider-bot. The project focuses on the implementation of kinematic modeling and trajectory generation using Screw Theory.

Repository Structure
The codebase is organized into two primary directories:

1. Forward and Backward Kinematics (Screw Theory)
This directory contains the core mathematical functions and algorithms used to compute:

Forward Kinematics: Determining the end-effector position based on joint angles.

Inverse Kinematics: Calculating required joint angles for a desired end-effector position.

2. Workspace for Testing
This folder contains the implementation scripts and simulation files used to generate the results presented in the thesis paper.

G-Code Generation: Scripts used to produce G-codes for the robot hardware.

Execution: The primary executable files in this directory follow the naming convention script.... Please run these files to reproduce the simulations or generate data.
